Random string of 10 letters =”wekzarloui”;

The first thing int goes in to is .toCharArray() tat makes the sting in to a char array, named chars
Then it goes into a for loop were “i” need to be gigger then the length of the string.
Then an if statement that checks it the char array on position “i”, and sees if it is matches with earlyLetter array {a,b,c,d} and if it does, it posts "early letter found" and goes to the next character in the string.
If its not a part of the earlyLetter, it goes in to another if statement but with lateLetter array {w,x,y,z} instead, and if it is correct it runs a RuntimeException and “posts this is a ” and the character. 
Else it posts “found” and the character. {e,f,g,h,I,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v}
